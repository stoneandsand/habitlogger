* DB Methods
Functions server will need from database:

** login / db.checkLogin(req.body)
   - Check if the username exists
   - Check if the password is correct.
   - Return an object to the router with the status of these operations
     - e.g., {username: true, password: false}

** signup / db.checkSignup(req.body)
   - Check if the username exists
   - If it does, router should redirect to login
   - If it does not, save the userdata in database
   - Return an object to the router with status of these operations
     - e.g., {savedNew: true, alreadyExists: false}

** get user's data 
*** getUserHabits / db.getUserHabits(username)
  - When the user logs in, we need to present their data
  - called by the client automatically on load
  - used to populate the dropdown
  - returns an array of habit names (strings)

*** getHabitData / db.getHabitData(habit)
  - used by default for the first habit on first load, request by client
  - used whenever the client selects a habit from the dropdown
  - used to populate the table and chart
   - The database will have to return user data to the router, which will then send it to the client
   - Returns an object with all the data needed for client to render
     - e.g. {smoking: {limit: 5, occurrences: []}

** occurence logged by user / db.logOccurrence(occurrence)
   - When the user logs an occurrence, we need to save that occurrence to the database
   - The database should let the router know if the operation was successful or if it failed
   - The router will pass this status onto the client

** habit created by user / db.createHabit(habit)
   - When the user logs an occurrence, we need to save that occurrence to the database
   - The database should let the router know if the operation was successful or if it failed
   - The router will pass this status onto the client
